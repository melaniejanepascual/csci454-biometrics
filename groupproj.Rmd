Plot the genuine distribution for each subject on the same graph. (hint. use the `lines` function to plot multiple curves on the same plot).

```{r}
library(reshape)
library(ggplot2)
scores <- read.table(file = "hwscores.csv", sep = ",")
dim(scores)

## Plot the genuine distribution for each subject on the same graph. (hint. use the `lines` function to plot multiple curves on the same plot).
colnames(scores) -> a
substring(a,1,3) -> a
names <- unique(a) 
a <- as.matrix(a)
allmatrices = vector("list", length(names))
for(i in 1:length(names)) {
  allmatrices[[i]] <- scores[which(a == names[i]), which(a == names[i])]
}
